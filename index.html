        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> [This site is under construction] </p>
<p>This is Paromita Shome. Welcome to my page. I am from Department of URP, BUET. Let me introduce you with planning first.	</p>
</p>The need of planning and planners in a developing country like Bangladesh is of great significance compared to a developed country. Our country has shown rapid economic progress. We are confronted with increasing urbanization, degrading environmental qualities, severe transportation problem, inequalities between groups of people and regions. To address these issues, there should be a shift in emphasis from previous planning process to a more down to earth approach. It is thus expected that governmental and non-governmental organizations will be more deeply involved in planning, administering and implementing projects aimed at overall physical, social and economic development in future. This will undoubtedly require a large number of planners who will serve communities to enhance their quality of life, work to promote equity and equality through fostering disadvantaged section of population and maintain a controlled and guided growth.</p>
